# AIID-Trend-Analysis

##Introduction
The year is 2014, you turn on the news, Ukraine is at war with Russia, there is a conflict between Israel and Hamas, and Tesla  just released their new AI powered  self-driving car…and people think it’s pretty cool. Ten years in the future, while some things have remained similar, the rhetoric surrounding AI is constantly at change.

This study aims to analyze just how the sentiment and subjectivity trends have changed surrounding the reporting of AI technologies and incidents. On a broader scale, What topics are falling in and out of the news cycle? How is the sentiment and subjectivity around AI reporting? For a more nuanced answer, can we identify what sites and sources are most prominent in the AI reporting space, and how they differ in sentiment? What about the most prominent individuals who report in this space? Who are they and what are their views like?

Just as we can identify when a news article around politics is leaning towards a certain agenda or bias, there really hasn’t been much awareness and research done on this end for AI reporting. By using the AI incidents database, our project aims to take the first steps in identifying these trends over time, and shine a light on how we should be viewing all the ever rising amount of news surrounding AI.

##Methodology
This project is realizable with the help of the AI incidents database. Currently, the AIID Dataset is the largest human curated and labeled resources of AI incidents with weekly updates to the incidents and reports. The data comes from a wide range of sources, consisting from news outlets, social media, forums, etc.

##The Journey Through Data: Narrating the Insights
Visualization and Explanation of the Cluster diagram: what are the major clusters, how have the clusters shifted over time, which are the clusters of greatest interest, analysis specific topic’s subjectivity over time
Visualization of Sentiment Over Time: Plots of the clusters over time with sentiment score, top 10 most interesting
Interpreting the Visuals: Show the most interesting key findings, and the clusters of interest, can we identify key dates that are important to ai reporting across the time period
Stories Behind the Data: For each significant trend or pattern, narrate the possible underlying reasons, referencing specific AI topics or incidents where applicable.

##Making It Relevant: Connecting With the Audience
Implications for the AI Community: The understanding of trends in reporting is important for the AI community because it determines support from the public, and how our technologies are influencing people, not just as a product, but psychologically. What do people want to see more of? What is the media negative about? What are the new trends that are appearing?
What It Means for the Public: Explain the significance of these trends for the general public, including how sentiment in AI reporting might affect public opinion and awareness.

##Conclusion: Wrapping Up with Actionable Insights
Recap of Key Findings: Summarize key findings
Call to Action: As the next step, we suggest the AIID create some simple human metrics when submitting articles.
The packages we have currently used are not tooled for the specific task
If a new check box could be added to the AIID website that allows the submitter to optionally say whether an article is sensational (positive), not sensational (neutral), or sensational (negative), we will be able to more accurately determine trends in reporting.
Looking Forward: As AI becomes more ingrained into our daily lives, the need to objectively look at the technology of the future is greater than ever.
