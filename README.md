The year is 2014, you turn on the news, Ukraine is at war with Russia, there is a conflict between Israel and Hamas, and Tesla  just released their new AI powered  self-driving car…and people think it’s pretty cool. Ten years in the future, while some things have remained similar, the rhetoric surrounding AI and the way we perceive this emerging technology has definitely changed.

This study aims to analyze just how the sentiment and subjectivity trends have changed surrounding the reporting of AI technologies and incidents. On a broader scale, What topics are falling in and out of the news cycle? How is the sentiment and subjectivity around AI reporting? For a more nuanced answer, can we identify what sites and sources are most prominent in the AI reporting space, and how they differ in sentiment? What about the most prominent individuals who report in this space? Who are they and what are their views like?

Just as we can identify when a news article around politics is leaning towards a certain agenda or bias, there really hasn’t been much awareness and research done on this end for AI reporting. By using the AI incidents database, our project aims to take the first steps in identifying these trends over time, and shine a light on how we should be viewing all the ever rising amount of news surrounding AI.
